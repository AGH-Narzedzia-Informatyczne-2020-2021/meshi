## Task Creation Process

1. Create an issue describing a task you want to work on. Tag the issue with a relevant tag (eg. **#Bug**, **#Feature**)

2. Get the issue **approved** and **scored/evaluated** (assign story points) by the rest of the team members.

3. From the **#dev** branch create a new branch named #issue- number. (eg. **Issue #235** -> **Branch #235**)

## Development Process

1. Work on the issue using the corresponding branch.

2. When finished open a new pull request. (See [Pull Request Process Section](#pull-request-process))

## Pull Request Process

1. Open a new Pull Request with the **#dev** as the destination branch. (__Never__ merge directly to **#main** branch!)

2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

4. Rerquest reviews from at least two other team members.

5. Resolve possible emerging issues highlighted by the reviewers.

6. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of **two other developers**, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
