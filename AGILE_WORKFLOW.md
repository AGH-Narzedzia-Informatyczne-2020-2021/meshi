# Agile workflow in Meshi project development

## Issue types

* ### **User Story**

  * is comprised of **sub-tasks**
  * describes a **larger** piece of system's **functionality**
  * describes a piece of system functionality from a **user's perspective**
  * summ of work from multiple people

  Needs to specify:

  * minimal **functional requirements** for User Story completion

* ### **Task**

  * is a basic building block of other, larger issues (**User Stories**) in the project
  * the smallest individual piece of work in the project
  * usually done by one person
  * are about implementation of the problem
  
  Needs to specify:
  
  * minimal requirements for task completion
  *  

* ### **Bug**

  * details **occurance conditions** of a specified bug
  
  Needs to specify:
  
  * **unwanted, unexpected behaviour** of the system (images, printscreens are welcomed)

## Writing Issues

### 1. **KISS** rule

  **K**eep **I**t **S**imple **S**illy\
  Be straight up and to the point. As mentioned above, i.e. code this, design that, create test data for this, validate test assumptions for that etc.

### 2. Headings

1. Descriptions

## Team meetings

* ### Standups
  
  * frequency: idealy every day (daily standups), for Meshi project **every other day**
  * duration: **~15 minutes**
  * purpose: status report from every team member, current work, plan for the day

* ### Sprint Planning

* ### Sprint Review 

## Task scoring system (**Agile points**)

System for evaluating task difficulty by the agile team.

## Additional definitions

* **Sprint**
: usually a **two week period** started by Sprint Planning session and ended by Sprint Review, logical organisation of work into time intervals, establishes a clear, intermediate deadline

* **Agile**
: iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
